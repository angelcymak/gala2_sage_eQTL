Summary statistics for cis- and trans-eQTLs, as well as TWAS models developed using data from GALA II and SAGE participants, can be found in [Zenodo (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.6622368)](https://zenodo.org/records/7735723)

## Project overview

This study included TOPMed WGS and whole transcriptome data generated from whole-blood samples of SAGE AA and GALA II Latino individuals (n = 2,733). We compared elements of the genetic architecture gene expression, such as cis-heritability and genetic variance, across participant groups defined based on self-identified race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry. We performed eQTL mapping and identified eQTLs that were specific to AFR or IAM ancestry. Finally, we developed genetic prediction models of whole-blood transcriptomes and performed comparative TWASs using GWAS summary statistics generated from the PAGE study and the UKB.
